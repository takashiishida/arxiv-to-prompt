A command-line tool to transform arXiv papers into a single LaTeX source that can be used as a prompt for asking LLMs questions about the paper. It downloads the source files, automatically finds the main tex file containing `\documentclass`, and flattens multiple files into a single coherent source by resolving `\input` and `\include` commands. The tool also provides an option to remove LaTeX comments from the output (which can be useful to shorten the prompt).

### Installation

```bash
pip install arxiv-to-prompt
```

### Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
# Display LaTeX source with comments
arxiv-to-prompt 2303.08774

# Display LaTeX source without comments
arxiv-to-prompt 2303.08774 --no-comments

# Copy to clipboard
arxiv-to-prompt 2303.08774 | pbcopy
```

The arXiv ID can be found in the paper's URL. For example, for `https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774`, the ID is `2303.08774`. It will automatically download the latest version of the paper, so you don't need to specify the version.

### Python API

You can also use arxiv-to-prompt in your Python code:

```python
from arxiv_to_prompt import process_latex_source

# Get LaTeX source with comments
latex_source = process_latex_source("2303.08774")

# Get LaTeX source without comments
latex_source = process_latex_source("2303.08774", keep_comments=False)
```
